      <p>My name is Sabrina and I'm on my way to becoming a fullstack developer! I grew up in Hawthorne, California where I
      reside to this day. Growing up
      I loved to draw and play video games. It was a form of expression for me as I didn't have much control in other aspects
      of my life. I went to a private school
      all of elementary and then spent four years in an even stricter high school: Hawthorne Math and Science Academy (yes,
      it's as terrible as it sounds). 
      <br>
       However, while attenting I was introduced to programming via Scratch. I had so much fun playing around on Scratch; it was another avenue for self expression, but it wasn't until college that I seriously considered programming as a career. On a whim, I took C and Swift classes at my local
      community college. I had the same professor for both
      classes and even though I struggled a lot, I can honestly say my professor for those classes encouraged me and helped me
      succeed. I learned to enjoy programming in those
      classes, however basic they may have been. Now, I look forward to diving deeper and expanding my knowledge to the best
      of my ability.
